            <h2>Principal's Message</h2>
            <img src="/images/principal.png" style="border-radius: 20px;" width="300" alt="" /> <br /> <br />
            Welcome to <b>Bolster Girls Campus</b>, a place where young minds are nurtured with care, confidence, and
            purpose.
            <br />
            At Bolster, we believe that educating girls is not just about academic excellence, but about shaping strong,
            compassionate, and independent individuals who are prepared to lead with integrity. Our campus is committed
            to creating a safe, inclusive, and stimulating environment where every student is encouraged to discover her
            potential and pursue her aspirations.
            <br />
            We place equal emphasis on intellectual growth, moral values, creativity, and life skills. Through dedicated
            teachers, a supportive learning culture, and a balanced curriculum, we strive to empower our students to
            face the challenges of the modern world with confidence and clarity.
            <br />
            Education is a shared journey. We value the trust and partnership of parents and the wider community in
            guiding our students toward a meaningful and responsible future.
            <br />
            I warmly invite you to explore Bolster Girls Campus and join us in our mission to inspire, educate, and
            empower the leaders of tomorrow.
            <br /> <br />
